# Portfolio Website

## Description
This is a personal portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS. The project involved creating the HTML skeleton and progressively styling it using CSS until completion. Throughout the process, I collaborated with my peer group, shared the project link for feedback, and received positive responses.

## Features
- Responsive design ensuring compatibility across devices
- Smooth navigation across different sections
- Interactive UI elements that respond beautifully to cursor movements

## Feedback and Collaboration
I received valuable feedback from the following members of my peer group:
- **Anifar Mariba**
- **Faith Sawe**
- **Realboga Matshedisho**

They all provided positive feedback on the project, which helped refine and improve it further.

## Project Status
Currently, my projects are incomplete as I have been focusing on tutorials to perfect my skills. Due to the limitations of my current device, which does not allow me to handle heavy projects, I am primarily working on skill development. Occasionally, when I have access to a more stable device—sometimes borrowed from a friend—I work on developing projects.
